## Contributing other photos

If GPO doesn't have a photo for someone in their member guide, we may be willing to accept a photo from another source.

In this case, [open a ticket](https://github.com/unitedstates/images/issues/new), and include:

* The name and Bioguide ID of the member of Congress.
* A link to the image you're suggesting we incorporate, and to a page that displays that image.
* Why you believe the image is definitely official and in the public domain.

When submitting a PR for an image found outside of the GPO, use the URL for the **context** of the photo, not the image source URL, as the value for `link: ` in `metadata/*.yaml`.
